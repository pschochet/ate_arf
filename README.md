# ate_arf
In clustered randomized controlled trials (RCTs), sample recruitment is often conducted after the randomization of clusters. This timing can lead to recruitment bias if access to the intervention affects the composition of cluster entrants in the study population and study consenters. The software, ate_arf.R, is an R function that estimates average treatment effects (ATEs) in these settings using an inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator developed in Schochet (Statistics in Medicine, 2024) for a causal estimand that pertains to the always-recruited in either research condition. The estimator uses data on recruits only and employs a generalized estimating equations approach to obtain clustered standard errors that adjusts for estimation error in the IPW weights from the propensity score logit models. The method allows for baseline covariates in the ATE regression models to obtain doubly robust ATE estimators.
